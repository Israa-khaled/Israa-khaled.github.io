    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concepts of standardisation and technology. By the end of the course, I was familiar with the significant roles of key organizations like 3GPP, ETSI, and ITU, understanding the differences between them and how they work to ensure that innovation remains consistent, interoperable, and scalable across vendors and countries—avoiding fragmentation and unpredictability.

    summary: |
      This course included several labs where I got to practice using supervised machine learning. I already knew the basics, but the course helped me focus on how to use it better and how to build projects using tools like TensorFlow and SymPy.

## About Me

Israa is a postdoctoral researcher at Télécom Paris, actively involved in the JEN project within the PEPR Future Networks program https://jen.irisa.fr/members/, and is associated with the Laboratory for Information, Networking and Communication Sciences (LINCS), a joint academy-industry research and innovation Lab https://www.lincs.fr/people/. Her current research focuses on the evolution of base station architectures and the accurate modeling of their energy consumption. She obtained her Ph.D. from IMT Atlantique in Brest in 2022, where she also completed a subsequent postdoctoral fellowship. Her expertise includes radio resource management in cellular networks, wake-up radio technologies for sensor networks, and emerging technologies such as massive MIMO, millimeter-wave communications, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces.
