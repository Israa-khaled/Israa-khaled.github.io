## Introduction

In modern wireless communication systems, **interference** is a critical performance-limiting factor. It directly impacts key metrics such as **Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR)**, **data throughput**, and **system reliability**. Among the various types of interference, **spatial inter-user interference** is particularly relevant in multi-user environments, especially in **massive MIMO** and **millimeter-wave (mmWave)** systems.

## What is Spatial Inter-User Interference?

In a multi-user system, especially one relying on spatial multiplexing, **inter-user interference** refers to the **unintended leakage** of the signal meant for one user into the channel of another. This results from imperfect spatial separation between users when served simultaneously by the same base station.

For example, in mmWave systems, where multiple users are served using highly directional beams, the beam intended for user A may partially overlap with the direction of user B, causing **angular domain interference**.

## Why Focus on Angular Information?

Measuring interference traditionally requires **full channel state information (CSI)**, which is costly to obtain and maintain, especially in large antenna systems. Fortunately, **mmWave channels** are highly directional and **sparse in the angular domain**, meaning most of the energy is concentrated in a small number of directions.

This property allows us to **approximate or estimate interference levels** using only the **angular location of users**—without needing full CSI. This is a significant advantage in mmWave systems where acquiring and updating full CSI is both complex and resource-intensive.

## How to Measure Interference Using Angular Information

Here are several methods:

### 1. Angular Separation Metric

- Define the angular position of each user (e.g., angle-of-departure from the base station).
- Calculate the **angular difference** between users.
- If the separation is small, there is a higher risk of interference.

### 2. Beam Pattern Analysis

- Use the beamwidth and steering angle of the transmitter to model how much energy spills into other users' directions.
- The **power overlap** between two beams can serve as a proxy for spatial interference.

### 3. Interference Correlation Functions

- Use spatial correlation or array response functions to model how much energy from one user’s beam leaks into another’s path.
- For a uniform linear array (ULA), this can be modeled using **sinc functions** of angular differences.

## Application in mmWave Massive MIMO

In **mmWave massive MIMO**, where the base station uses hundreds of antennas, the angular domain becomes a natural framework for analyzing spatial interference:

- **Low-rank channels** in mmWave enable the use of angular metrics instead of full channel matrices.
- **Beamforming algorithms** (e.g., angle-domain digital or hybrid precoding) rely on angular separation to serve users simultaneously.
- Clustering users based on angular compatibility can **reduce inter-user interference**.

## A Simple Angular Interference Metric

Here’s a simplified example:

If two users have estimated angles θ₁ and θ₂, the interference metric \( \mathcal{I}(\theta_1, \theta_2) \) can be defined as:
